# Darkstar Coders Order Tracking app:
This is a single page app that was created to help a local Mom and Pop pizza joint. The company wanted an app that could crud for orders and their items. The company also wanted a page to view their revenue excluding tips. The app is genereated thru Javascript with a basic .html layout.

## About the User:
- This is a basic order tracking app
- This was a group project that was a means to test the knowledge that we gained up to this point.
- As a group, we learned the importance of being timely and how to share the responsibilities on the app.

## Features
- A login screen for a google authentication
- A home screen with 3 buttons, view orders, create order, and revenue
- The view orders page shows all orders that have been created.
- Create orders page allows the user to input important data relevant to the customer.
- The relevant button on the Order card allow the user to edit, update, and delete.
- The same thing is also relevant to the Items also, create, edit, update, and delete.
- The revenue page deals with adding the total of all order items together and showing how much the company made.
